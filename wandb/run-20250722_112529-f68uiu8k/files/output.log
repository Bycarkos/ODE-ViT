torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 294.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 44.35 GiB of which 1.19 MiB is free. Process 1422623 has 40.98 GiB memory in use. Process 1651332 has 2.97 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 380.00 MiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 90.74 MiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 29.26 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
